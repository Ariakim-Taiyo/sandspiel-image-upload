How to upload images onto sandspiel.club <br>
You will need to get your image link, preferably 300x300 px resolution. You can rescale with sites like ezgif.<br>
You then convert that image to base64 with an online converter. I use https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image<br>
Follow the commented instructions in the code.
